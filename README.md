Developed a responsive and interactive web-based tool using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to estimate total time required for completing multiple components or tasks.

<h2>ey Features:</h2>

Users can input component/task details, including:

<ol>
<li>Component Name</li>
<li>Time per Page (minutes)</li>
